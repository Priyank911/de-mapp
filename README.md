Meet De-MAPP, a decentralized protocol that enables **persistent memory across AI agents**.

Thanks to [Avalanche's high-performance blockchain infrastructure](https://www.avax.network/) and advanced cryptographic security, De-MAPP solves the fundamental problem of memory fragmentation in AI interactions. With distributed storage that maintains conversation context, cross-platform synchronization capabilities, and privacy-preserving encryption, De-MAPP creates a universal memory layer that any AI system can utilize. While traditional AI services operate in isolated environments where each conversation starts fresh, this protocol provides a persistent foundation where your interactions, preferences, and context follow you across every AI platform.

1. **Connect your AI services** and establish persistent memory vaults secured by your Web3 wallet.
2. **De-MAPP analyzes** your interaction patterns and conversation history to optimize memory allocation across distributed networks.
3. **Once integrated**, De-MAPP can:
    - Maintain conversation context that persists across sessions and platforms
    - Enable cross-agent knowledge sharing while preserving privacy through encryption
    - Synchronize preferences and learned behaviors across multiple AI services simultaneously
    - Create verifiable audit trails for all memory operations on the blockchain
4. **When tasks complete**, De-MAPP ensures all context is permanently stored in decentralized infrastructure, accessible only through your cryptographic keys.

> **Note:** De-MAPP transforms isolated AI conversations into a connected intelligence network where your digital interactions accumulate value over time, creating a persistent AI companion that truly understands your needs.

### Memory Vault Management

De-MAPP creates and manages persistent memory vaults directly through your connected services, presenting you with a comprehensive view of all stored interactions. You can organize, search, and analyze your AI conversation history with advanced filtering and visualization tools.

The system automatically categorizes conversations by topic, sentiment, and importance, while maintaining complete user control over data organization and access permissions. All memory operations are recorded in your vault's timeline, providing an easy way to track and manage your digital interactions.

**Vault Features:**
- Automatic conversation categorization and tagging
- Advanced search across all stored interactions
- Visual timeline of memory operations and access patterns
- Granular privacy controls with selective sharing capabilities
- Integration with existing productivity workflows

<img align="left" width="370" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc2e85ba-dfeb-4fe6-9942-7cfc4703cbe5">

### Cross-Platform Synchronization

With De-MAPP's universal memory protocol, context and preferences seamlessly transfer between AI services. Start a conversation in ChatGPT, continue it in Claude, and reference the context in GitHub Copilot – all while maintaining perfect continuity.

The protocol handles real-time synchronization of conversation states, learned preferences, and contextual relationships across all connected platforms. Advanced conflict resolution ensures consistency when multiple services access the same memory simultaneously.

**Synchronization Capabilities:**
- Real-time context sharing across all AI platforms
- Intelligent conflict resolution for concurrent access
- Preference learning that improves recommendations over time
- Cross-platform conversation threading and relationship mapping
- Automatic backup and redundancy across multiple storage nodes

### "Configure memory for..."

De-MAPP supports extensible memory configurations tailored to specific use cases. The protocol can be customized for different workflows, from software development and creative writing to research and business intelligence.

Just specify your use case and De-MAPP will automatically configure optimal memory patterns, storage strategies, and synchronization rules. These configurations can be shared with teams or published as templates for the community.

**Example Configurations:**
- **Software Development**: Code context, documentation references, and debugging sessions
- **Content Creation**: Research notes, writing drafts, and creative iteration tracking  
- **Business Intelligence**: Meeting summaries, decision tracking, and strategic planning
- **Academic Research**: Literature reviews, experiment tracking, and collaboration notes

### Memory Snapshots

As you interact with AI services, De-MAPP automatically creates memory snapshots at key conversation milestones. You can use the 'Compare' feature to see how your AI interactions have evolved over time, and the 'Restore' function to revisit previous conversation states.

For complex projects spanning multiple AI platforms, you can create manual snapshots before major transitions, then restore to those points if you want to explore alternative approaches. This enables safe experimentation with different AI strategies while maintaining your progress.

**Snapshot Features:**
- Automatic milestone detection and snapshot creation
- Manual snapshot creation for important conversation states
- Cross-platform comparison showing interaction evolution
- Selective restoration of conversation contexts or complete memory states
- Collaborative snapshots for team-based AI workflows
